# Cat in Space Eats Tacos

A simple HTML browser game built by Jason Delgado using vibe coding. Control a space kitty, collect as many ðŸŒ® tacos as possible before time runs out, and learn coding through play.

## How to Play

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Use **arrow keys** or **WASD** to move the kitty.
- Collect tacos while the timer counts down. Try to eat as many as you can!

## Project Structure

- `index.html` â€” the game
- (Optional: any images or sound files used by the game)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Or host it on GitHub Pages and share the link so others can play directly online.

## Why This Project Matters

This is the first project of the **Vibe Coding Learning Lab**, created to help Jason practice building interactive web games, learn real-world tech skills, and explore entrepreneurship. Every line of code is a step in a creative, educational journey.
